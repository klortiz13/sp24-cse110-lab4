### var Declaration
1. Line 9 will print `'values added: ',20`
Since the print arguments are from different data types, `'values added: '` is a string and `20` is an integer.
2. Line 13 will print `final result: ,20`
Similar to questio 1, this print output has 2 data types, a string `final result: ` followed by a comma (to separate the values) and an integer `20`.

### let Declaration
3. Line 9 will print `'values added: ',20` because line 9 is inside the block where `let result` was declared.
4. Line 13 returns an `Uncaught ReferenceError: result is not defined` because line 13 is **outside** the block where `let result` was created. Thus, the print statement doesn't know what `result` is, throwing an Uncaught Reference Error.

### const Declaration
5. The code doesn't even reach line 9 (or any code after line 7) because `result` is a constant variable and the problem is that we're trying to reassing its value on line 7, which is illegal. 
We get an `Uncaught TypeError: "result" is read-only`.
6. Same problem as question 5 above.
